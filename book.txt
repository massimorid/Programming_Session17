For this lesson, I am expecting you to use the C++ documentation to look up the functions and
classes you need. I will not be providing the exact syntax for each function, but I will give you
the general idea of what you need to do.
Trust cppreference with your life. Avoid cplusplus, geeksforgeeks is cool, but easily
outdated so always check the date of the article and take it into account
